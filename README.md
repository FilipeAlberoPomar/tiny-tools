In here you'll find tiny scripts I created to automate some repetitive tasks.

The code snippets here are messy, half-formed and unpolished.



### Backup Encrypter 🔐
Give it a directory and it will generate an encrypted tarball. It has a snazzy UI reminiscent of the 1980s. And uses shasum, tar, and openssl that ship with MacOS

### HDD Synchronizer 🔄
Nothing but a glofied terminal menu that executes rsyncs across external HDDS

### Sample Code 📖
Yup. My personal cheat sheet of Python syntax. I was born a Java developer, so I still hold dear to my Python training wheels

### School Finder 🎒
Give it a list of primary and secondary school postcodes. And it will give you a list of the primary/secondary schools closest to each other. Why? To help chosing the kid's schools. Needs tweaking

### Sha1 Directory Checker ✅
What the name says. Can be used against the encrypted backups to identify corrupted files

### Wifi Tester 📡
A glorified ping that logs round trips and errors. Handy to identify connectivity issues
